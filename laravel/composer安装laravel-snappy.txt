#composer安装barryvdh/laravel-snappy

Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - barryvdh/laravel-snappy dev-master requires illuminate/support ^9|^10 -> found illuminate/support[v9.0.0-beta.1, ..., 9.x-dev, v10.0.0, ..., 10.x-dev] but these were not loaded, likely because it conflicts with another require.
    - barryvdh/laravel-snappy v1.0.0 requires illuminate/support ^6|^7|^8|^9 -> found illuminate/support[v6.0.0, ..., 6.x-dev, v7.0.0, ..., 7.x-dev, v8.0.0, ..., 8.x-dev, v9.0.0-beta.1, ..., 9.x-dev] but these were not loaded, likely because it conflicts with another require.
    - barryvdh/laravel-snappy 1.0.x-dev is an alias of barryvdh/laravel-snappy dev-master and thus requires it to be installed too.
    - Root composer.json requires barryvdh/laravel-snappy ^1.0 -> satisfiable by barryvdh/laravel-snappy[v1.0.0, 1.0.x-dev (alias of dev-master)].

You can also try re-running composer require with an explicit version constraint, e.g. "composer require barryvdh/laravel-snappy:*" to figure out if any version is installable, or "composer require barryvdh/laravel-snappy:^2.1" if you know which you need.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json and ./composer.lock to their original content.

解决方法：
1、下载安装wkhtmltopdf
官网下载地址：https://wkhtmltopdf.org/index.html
选择适合自己电脑的版本，我选择的max Os,下载后点击安装。

2、mac由于权限问题会安装失败，提示无法打开“wkhtmltox-0.12.6-2.macos-cocoa.pkg”，因为它来自身份不明的开发者。
打开电脑"系统偏好设置"->"安全性与隐私"->"通用"，打开锁按钮，允许执行该程序。
